  title={Performance Analysis of GLRT-Based SIMO-OFDM Demodulation With Pilot-Aided Channel Estimation},
  author={Jy-Chin Liao and Wei-Chang Chen and Char-Dir Chung},
  abstract={Pilot symbols are commonly inserted into uniformly interleaved subcarriers
  to aid channel estimation, thereby facilitating data demodulation in
  practical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems
  operating over block dispersive channels where the channel frequency
  response (CFR) remains static only over a few blocks. Aided by uniformly
  interleaved pilot symbols, the direct least-square (LS) CFR estimation can
  enable reliable symbol-by-symbol data demodulation within the same OFDM
  block in the absence of channel state information, based on the principle of
  generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). Such GLRT-based OFDM can be easily
  incorporated with single-input multiple-output (SIMO) antenna technique to
  enhance data demodulation over severe block channel dispersion. In this
  paper, upper bounds to the bit error probability (BEP) are analytically
  derived for this GLRT-based SIMO-OFDM system over both deterministic and
  random block dispersive channels. The BEP analysis is generally applicable
  to arbitrary two-dimensional component modulations when the SIMO channel
  consists of deterministic channel paths or independent but not identically
  distributed random channel paths with a known marginal statistic of CFR
  magnitudes. The BEP upper bounds are verified by simulation to exhibit tight
  performance results in pilot-aided SIMO reception, and thus facilitate the
  error performance characterization of GLRT-based SIMO-OFDM system with
  respect to data-to-noise power ratio, data-to-pilot power ratio, antenna
  diversity, and channel condition.},
