## About Me
Hi! My name is Jy-Chin Liao (廖芝青 in Chinese). 

I previously received my master's degree in [Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering](https://comm.ntu.edu.tw/en/) at [National Taiwan 
University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in 2021, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. 
[Char-Dir Chung](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=901162) and worked on performance analysis of channel estimation and data decision.
I also received my bachelor’s degree in [Department of Communication Engineering](http://www.ce.ncu.edu.tw/english/index.html) at 
[National Central University](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/en/index) as the valedictorian of my department in 2019.

My current research interests include wireless communications and signal processing.
