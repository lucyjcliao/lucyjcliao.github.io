## About Me
Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://eceweb.rice.edu) at Rice University. Currently, I work with [Dr. Edward Knightly](https://knightly.rice.edu) at [Rice Networks Group](https://networks.rice.edu).

My current research interests include wireless communications and metasurface.

I previously received my master's degree in Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering
at National Taiwan University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. 
[Char-Dir Chung](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=901162).
I also received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Department of Communication Engineering at 
National Central University.
